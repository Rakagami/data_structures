# Data Structures in C

A little side project of mine of basically a cookbook of different data structures
implemented in C with C23.

## Quick-Start

You can compile everything like this:

```
git clone [url to this repository]
cd data_structures
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Test Setup

Tests are currently implemented manually with cmake. You can run the tests with `make test`.
You can also find the test binaries under `build/tests/`.
